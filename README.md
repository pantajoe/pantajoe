## Hello there! <img src="https://media.tenor.com/SNL9_xhZl9oAAAAi/waving-hand-joypixels.gif" width="30px">

My name is Joe and I'm currently the Lead Software Engineer at [Mate](https://mate-studio.com).

I've been working in web development for a little bit over 7 years now. I love DX, Monads, and TypeScript. Starting out with Ruby on Rails,
I've moved professionally towards TypeScript, React, and Nest.js. While I genuinely love TypeScript and React, I've learned
that I greatly value simplicity and an awesome DX with regards to my tooling, so for my private projects I tend to use Vue.js and Ruby on Rails.
